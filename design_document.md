# Harmonic Oscillation Graphics Tool — Design Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a public web-based creative graphics tool/toy inspired by harmonic oscillation. The site features a square-shaped main display window where graphics generated by oscillatory algorithms are visualized in real-time.

A secondary settings window can be shown or hidden, allowing users to manage and tweak parameters graphically. Users interact with the settings using intuitive keyboard and mouse controls. Changes in these settings immediately influence the graphical output in the main display area, enabling playful exploration and creative discovery.

The tool aims to be accessible, visually engaging, and responsive, appealing to artists, educators, and hobbyists interested in generative art and mathematical visualization.

## 2. Background & Inspiration

### Harmonic Oscillation in Graphics

Harmonic oscillation describes smooth, periodic motion, commonly seen in physics as the movement of springs, pendulums, or waves. Oscillatory systems have inspired a wide range of generative graphics, from classic Lissajous figures to modern algorithmic art.

### Artistic and Educational Roots

Generative artists have long used mathematical oscillations to create mesmerizing patterns, animations, and interactive experiences. Tools like spirographs, music visualizers, and interactive pendulum simulators translate mathematical formulas into creative visual outputs, often blurring the line between science and art.

This project draws inspiration from:
- **Classic mechanical toys** (e.g., spirographs, pendulum drawing machines)
- **Mathematical visualizations** (e.g., Lissajous curves, Fourier series illustrations)
- **Modern creative coding platforms** (e.g., Processing, p5.js, Desmos, and online math-art communities)

The following images illustrate the type of complex, colorful structures that can emerge from the superposition of harmonic oscillations and articulated radii:

### Technical Background: Articulated Radii

The core mathematical paradigm is "articulated radii." A set of vectors (or arms) is anchored at the origin point (0,0). Each vector rotates at its own individual angular speed, and their sequential summation determines the position of the endpoint. At every animation step, the endpoint pixel is colored, creating a continuous path. The tool records the history of these endpoint positions, enabling future erasure and control over the display of the path. The resulting motion is snake-like and dependent on a global length parameter and the configuration of the vectors.

## 3. Core Features

### User-Controlled Parameters

- **Global Parameters**
  - **Snake Length:**  
    The total length of the snake-like path. This is a global variable affecting the entire visualization.
  - **Color Assignment:**  
    Users assign colors (white, black, red, blue, green) to segments of a horizontal bar that represents the snake’s extent.

- **Per-Vector Parameters**  
  Each member of the articulated radii set (vector) has its own attributes:
  - **Vector Length:**  
    The magnitude of the individual vector.
  - **Vector Rotation Speed:**  
    The angular velocity of the vector.
  - **Variance:**  
    Each integer attribute (length, rotation speed, etc.) can be adjusted by modifying its variance value, which can be doubled or halved to increase or decrease precision.

### Interactive Controls

- All parameters are adjusted through graphical UI elements, as well as keyboard and mouse input.
- Updates to any parameter are reflected immediately in the main display window.

### Visual Feedback

- The main display window visualizes the evolving path generated by the articulated radii, colored according to the horizontal bar’s assignments.
- The settings window provides graphical feedback for parameter changes and can be shown or hidden.
